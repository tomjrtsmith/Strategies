# Strategies

My collection of strategies that have been tested on the [Freqtrade trading bot](https://www.freqtrade.io/en/stable/), together with their backtesting results and hyperopt files (when available). 

These strategies are gathered from sources like Github, Youtube and misc. websites. Some of them will also be completely new and developed by myself. 
I will try to add the source of each strategy so that the original authors get the credits they deserve for their hard work!

You can use all this information in your own strategies, just as long as you remember that **everything is at your own risk**!!
